# 🚖 Insights from City Supply and Demand Data

This project analyzes city supply and demand data, originally used as a take-home assignment for data science recruitment at Uber. The goal is to derive key insights and patterns related to trip requests, driver supply, and demand fluctuations over a two-week period.

---

## 📌 Assignment Objectives

Using the provided dataset, this analysis answers the following questions:

1. **🚗 Peak Trip Volume**
   - Which date had the most completed trips during the two-week period?
   - What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24-hour period?

2. **⏰ Hourly Demand Analysis**
   - Which hour of the day had the most trip requests?
   - What percentage of all zero requests occurred on weekends?  
     *(Weekend is defined as Friday at 5 PM to Sunday at 3 AM.)*

3. **📊 Driver Performance & Efficiency**
   - What is the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver?  
     *(Weighted by total trip volume in each hour.)*

4. **🕗 Optimal Driver Shifts**
   - What are the busiest **8-hour consecutive shifts** for drivers?  
     *(Assume shifts start every 8 hours, and a driver works the same shift daily.)*

5. **📈 Supply vs. Demand Trends**
   - **True or False:** Does driver supply always increase when demand increases?  
     *(Visualizations may help confirm this.)*

6. **📉 Highest Ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs**
   - In which **72-hour period** is the ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs the highest?

7. **👥 Optimizing Driver Allocation**
   - If you could **add 5 drivers** to any single hour of every day, which hour should you choose?  
     *(Consider both rider demand and driver supply when making this decision.)*

8. **📅 Data Timeframe & End-of-Day Definition**
   - **True or False:** Does the dataset cover exactly **two weeks**?
   - What time should be considered the "true end of the day" instead of midnight?  
     *(Determine when both supply and demand are at their natural minimums.)*
